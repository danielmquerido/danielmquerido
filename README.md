My name is Daniel Querido,

I've just finnished an intensive 9 weeks data-science bootcamp with Le Wagon.

During this period i learned a lot about data analytics, visualization, machine learning and deep learning.

I'm currently looking for my first job in this area, until then I will keep on coding, improving the skills that I already have and learning new ones, like web developing.

I'm passionate about photography, specially analog photography.
